## Inspiration
We were inspired by the ongoing global climate crisis, and Daniel's Dad's decision to have a passive house.

## What it does
It is a game that encourages and teaches good habits to save energy and resources in the house.

## How we built it
We built it using blood, sweat, tears, stackoverflow, medium tutorials, unity docs, lots of sunkist orange soda, and an apple pencil.

## Challenges we ran into
Only Bradley had any experience with Unity, and it was not enough to carry us or even himself, so we had to learn how to use it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We got buttons to click, stick figures to walk, and scenes to switch.

## What we learned
We learned that we should get in the line for dinner 10 minutes before dinner starts.

## What's next for Energy Undead
It will be worked on until 8 AM.
